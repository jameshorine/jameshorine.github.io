Hi, there! I am a first-year D.Eng student at Penn State's [School of Engineering Design and Innovation](https://www.sedi.psu.edu/){target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on the theory and methods of building engineered systems for simulation and evaluation of market and non-market economic impacts.

I currently serve as a Lead (Applied) Scientist at Bayer, with over 10 years of experience spanning Agriculture, Aviation, Management Consulting, Marketing/Advertising Analytics, Marketing & Consumer Analytics, Technology Services, Education and Training, and Pure-Play R&D.
