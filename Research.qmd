# Research Projects and Collaborations:

-   [fastFeatures](https://github.com/jameshorine/fastFeatures) is an `R` package built from the ground up with one goal in mind: High-speed variable selection in typical statistical/data science settings so that you may (and shall) build a predictive model that is easy to explain and share.
-   [TidyAgronomy](https://github.com/modern-agronomy/tidyagronomy) is the first “tidyverse” `R` Package to unify the data and model framework of commonly used features for agronomic data science at scale.
